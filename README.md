# Motion Algorithm Simulation

This project includes files for various algorithms that I wanted to try by first visualising to determine whether it was even worthwhile to pursue. It contains logic for Pure Pursuit, Curve Follower, and an algorithm as mentioned in "WHEELED MOBILE ROBOTICS FROM FUNDAMENTALS TO AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS" by GREGOR KLANCAR, ANDREJ ZDEAR, SAO BLAIC, and IGOR KRJANC.

Credits to Sarah from team ICTRL for a lot of the resources used.
