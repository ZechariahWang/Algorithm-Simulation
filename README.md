# Motion Algorithm Simulation

This project includes simulations for various algorithms that I wanted to implement. It contains logic for Pure Pursuit, Curve Follower, PID, and an algorithm as mentioned in "WHEELED MOBILE ROBOTICS FROM FUNDAMENTALS TO AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS" by GREGOR KLANCAR, ANDREJ ZDEAR, SAO BLAIC, and IGOR KRJANC.

Credits to Sarah from team iCTRL for tutorials and resources used within the simulations.
